        ## MQTT
        ##### Global Code

        ## How do systems communicate?
        * Web: browser -> server
        * Email: sender -> receivers
        * Chat: senders -> receivers
        * ...?

        ## How do systems communicate?
        * How do they know *how* to communicate?
          * Data formats
          * Protocols
        
        ---
        
        ## Pub/Sub
        One common pattern for communication
        * One "Publisher"
        * Many "Subscribers"
        
        ---
        
        ## Publisher
        * Sends messages
        * Just plain text
          * You decide the protocol
          * And the data format!
        
        ---
        
        ## Subscriber
        * Subscribes to topics
          * Like a chat room
          * Can subscribe more than once
        * Publisher can also subscribe!

        ## How do I use it
        * Firstly we'll use mosquitto
          * You installed it last week
          * sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
        
        Note:
        
        Here, you should get the mqtt server details and run the wildcard subscriber on the big screen
        Tell the students how to subscribe to topics - for example, their name, and how they can send messages either to the screen or each other. This is usually pretty wild so let them have fun & make sure everyone is working before you move on:
        
        mosquitto_sub -t test/all -h \<hostname\>.com
        mosquitto_pub -t test/all -h \<hostname\>.com -m "Hello Class!"

        ## How do I use it in code?
        * A python library called paho
          * pip install paho-mqtt

        Note:
        
        Paho is very well documented and our use right now is very simple:
        https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/
        
        A nice thing to do here is just write out the code yourself, and have the class type along with you. Stop regularly to talk about what you're doing:
         * What's the difference between `pip install paho-mqtt` and `import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt`?
         * What's the difference between client.on_connect = on_connect and on_connect()?
         * Why do we set up the callbacks before we connect?
         * Why do we loop_forever?
