       ## Modules
       * Functions are organised into *modules* and *packages*
         * Reusable units of code
         * `reusability == good`!
       * Each *file* is a *module*
       * Each *directory* is a *package*

       ## Modules
       * `import package.subpackage.module`

       ## Modules
       * We're working mostly with functions
       * Python has *much* more
         * Classes and objects
         * Inheritance
