## Modules
* Functions are organised into *modules* and *packages*
  * Reusable units of code
  * `reusability == good`!
* Each *file* is a *module*
* Each *directory* is a *package*

---
## Modules
* `import package.subpackage.module`
* You can install additional modules on your machine

---
## Modules
* We're working mostly with functions
* Python has *much* more
  * Classes and objects
  * Inheritance
* In fact, everything in Python is an Object
