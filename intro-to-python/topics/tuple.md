        ## Tuple
        A way to join related data:
        ```python
        hostport = ("accdev1", 3213)
        ```

        ## Tuple
        Data elements don't have names
        ```python
        sam = ("Sam Moorhouse", 1984)
        ```
        * What does *1984* refer to? (Careful!)
        * Is there a better way?
