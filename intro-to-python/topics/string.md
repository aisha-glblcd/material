## String
Use "" or '', doesn't matter (unlike some other languages):
```sh
>>> print ("hello" == 'hello')
True
```

---
## String
...or Unicode (with care!)
```sh
>>> command = "⌘"
>>> command
'\xe2\x8c\x98'
>>> print (command)
⌘
```

---
## String
Some *builtin* functions work with variables:
```sh
>>> len("hello")
5
```
